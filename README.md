A personal website for me, Patrick McNamara. :)

It is 100% UTF-8 plaintext and will stay that way. I am trying to keep the
website as small as possible as I want it to load as quickly as possible. You
might think it's ugly, but I like it.

It is completely free. You can redistribute it and/or modify it as you wish
under the terms of [the EUPL v1.2](https://patrickmcnamara.xyz/LICENCE.txt).
